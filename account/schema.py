        The resolve_user_details function is a resolver function that returns the user details of the currently logged in user.
        It takes three arguments: root, info, and **kwargs. The root argument is required by all resolve functions and contains data about the query itself;
        the info argument contains information about the execution state of a query (e.g., which field is being resolved);
        and kwargs are any additional keyword arguments passed to GraphQLâ€™s execute method.

            root: Represent the root of the graphql
            info: Get access to the context of the request
            **kwargs: Accept any additional arguments that may be passed to the field
